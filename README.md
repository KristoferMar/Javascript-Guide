<h1>Javascript knowledge</h1>


<h2>Javascript fundamentals</h2>
Javascript is is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web. It's a core programming language in most frontend framework and is also widely used in node.js for backend development.<br>

<h2>What is it?</h2>
Javascript is impeded in most browsers these days and compilers for javascript are therefore all over the internet all the time. <br>

Javascript projects can be both very small and large, in javascript we refer to a single ".js" file as a javascript module. <br>
A moduele can be both exported and importet into other modules and they can hold classes, functions or even just individual variables. <br>

<h2>How to use</h2>
Javascript files can be executed in the following way in this project. <br><br>
<i>node script.js </i> <br><br>
It's also possible to run javascipt files through index.html files with the '<'script> reference. <br>
<br>
<h3> Variables - var, let & const </h3>
We should always go with let and cost as our variable choice. <br>
- var has a more global scope which can introduce erros in many cases. Var's are changeable.<br>
- let has a more local scope which lets us control our variables better. It's also changeable.<br>
- const is a static constant which cannot be reassigned or changed once set. <br>
<h3>Data Types in Javascript </h3>
There are two types of datatypes<br>
- Primitive Data Types: are stored directly in the location the variable accesses. Stored on the stack. <br>
- Reference Data Types: Accessed by reference. Objects that are stored on the heap. A pointer to a location in memory. <br>
