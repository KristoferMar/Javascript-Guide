<h3> Variables - var, let & const </h3>

We should always go with let and cost as our variable choice. 

- var has a more global scope which can introduce erros in many cases. Var's are changeable.
- let has a more local scope which lets us control our variables better. It's also changeable.
- const is a static constant which cannot be reassigned or changed once set. 

<h3>Data Types in Javascript </h3>

There are two types of datatypes
- Primitive Data Types: are stored directly in the location the variable accesses. Stored on the stack. 
- Reference Data Types: Accessed by reference. Objects that are stored on the heap. A pointer to a location in memory.
