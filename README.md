### Variables - var, let & const

We should always go with let and cost as our variable choice. 

- var has a more global scope which can introduce erros in many cases. Var's are changeable.
- let has a more local scope which lets us control our variables better. It's also changeable.
- const is a static constant which cannot be reassigned or changed once set.
