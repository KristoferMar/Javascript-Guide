<h1>Functions</h1>

From the book "Clean Code"<br>

<p>The ideal number of arguments for a function is zero (niladic). Next comes one (monadic), followed closely by two (dyadic). Three arguments (triadic) should be avoided where possible. More than three (polyadic) requires very special justifications and then shouldn't be used anyway. </p>
