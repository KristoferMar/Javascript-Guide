### API

API stands for Application Programming Interface
- Contract provided by one piece of software to another.
- Structured request and response
- We just worked an API that takes a request and responds with jokes. 

### REST 

Representational State Transfer
- Architecture style for designing networked applications. 
- Relies on a stateless, client-server protocol, almost always HTTP.
- Treats server objects as resources that can be created or destroyed. 
- Can be used by virtually any programming language 
- All APIS have their own rules and structures. 

### Different type of requests 

- GET: Retrieve data from a specific resource
- POST: Submit data to be processed to a specific resource
- PUT: Update a specified resource
- DELETE: Delete a specific resource

- HEAD: Same as get but does not return a body.
- OPTIONS: Returns the supported HTTP methods.
- PATCH: Update partial resources.
